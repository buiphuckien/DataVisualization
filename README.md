Plotting is a common task in data analysis. We plot data to help us figure out the patterns behind the data. Additionally, Visualizing gives us the intuition about the data.

In this project, I use four jupyter notebook files to illustrate how to plot data using Python Matplotlib.

    barChart.ipynb shows how to plot a bar chart with a given table.

    lineChart.ipynb and scatterPlot dipict visualizing time-seried data using line chart and scatter plot.

    pieChart.ipynb covers plotting a pie chart using Matplotlib.

By modifying the code a bit, you can use the code to visualize your own data.
